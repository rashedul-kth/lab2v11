REM -- This file is for starting a Jini Lookup Server on a Ms Windows PC.
REM -- You will need to customise this file - see below.

REM -- This file launches the Jini sample registrar implementation (reggie)
REM -- This file uses Windows NT command extensions.
REM -- Fredrik Kilander, DSV

REM -- INSTRUCTIONS BEFORE USE
REM -- Put this file in the  bin  directory of the lab file-tree.
REM -- Make sure that you have completed the installation of r2_rmid.bat
REM -- Put the file reggie.jar in the  lib  directory of the lab file-tree.
REM -- Make sure that you have a working HTTP server for your codebase, and
REM -- that the file reggie-dl.jar is reachable from it.

REM -- The easiest way to start and stop the reggie Lookup Service, is to
REM -- Start:
REM --   run  r2_rmid
REM --   run  r3_reggie
REM -- Run your programs, do work for as long as it takes...
REM -- Stop:
REM --   Open a Windows command prompt and give the command
REM --     rmid -stop
REM --   This will shut down rmid and reggie as well.

REM -- This codebase definition is just a default and an example.
REM -- If you use it, make sure that it points to a working HTTP
REM -- server. Test it with a web-browser.

Set HTTP=http://%COMPUTERNAME%:8080

REM -- It is probably better to use the information written out by
REM -- the HTTPD server when it was launched. That way we only need
REM -- to maintain information in one place.
